# Volume of N Cones Calculator

This program calculates the total volume of N cones, where N is a number entered by the user.

## Description

The Volume of N Cones program computes the total volume of a user-defined number of cones based on their height and radius. The user enters the number of cones, followed by the height and radius for each cone. The program outputs the total volume of all cones combined.

## Usage

1. Compile the C program using your preferred compiler or IDE.
2. Run the compiled program.
3. Follow the prompts to enter the number of cones, height, and radius for each cone.
4. The program will output the total volume of all cones.

## Example

```plaintext
Welcome to the Volume of Cones Program
How many Cones do you wish to calculate? 2
Enter the radius for cone 1: 5
Enter the height for cone 1: 7
Enter the radius for cone 2: 3
Enter the height for cone 2: 4
The total volume of 2 cones is 220.48
```
