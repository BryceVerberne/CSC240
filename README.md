# CSC 240 - Introduction to Different Programming Languages

Welcome to my CSC240 repository! This repository contains projects from my CSC 240 course: Introduction to Different Programming Languages, taken at Scottsdale Community College, taught by Professor Meacham.

## Course Description

CSC 240 is a course that covers the fundamentals of various programming languages, such as Scheme, Prolog, C, and C++. It provides a solid foundation in understanding the unique features, syntax, and paradigms of each language, enabling students to develop their problem-solving skills and adapt to new programming environments.

## Repository Contents

This repository contains the following types of programs:

- **Scheme Programs**: Functional programming examples written in Scheme.
- **Prolog Programs**: Logic programming examples and exercises written in Prolog.
- **C Programs**: Procedural programming examples and assignments written in C.
- **C++ Programs**: (Coming soon) Object-oriented programming examples and projects written in C++.

## Getting Started

To run and modify the code in this repository, you will need the appropriate compilers or interpreters for each programming language:

- For **Scheme**, install an interpreter such as [Racket](https://racket-lang.org/).
- For **Prolog**, install a compiler such as [SWI-Prolog](https://www.swi-prolog.org/).
- For **C** and **C++**, install a compiler such as [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/).

## Disclaimer

These projects are provided for educational purposes only. While the code is free to use, modify, or distribute, please do not use it to directly copy or plagiarize assignments for your coursework. Instead, use the material as a reference to help you understand the unique features, syntax, and paradigms of each langauge.
