# CSC 240 - Introduction to Different Programming Languages

This repository contains programs written for the CSC240 Introduction to Different Programming Languages course at Scottsdale Community College, taught by Professor Meacham.

## Course Description

CSC240 covers the fundamentals of various programming languages, such as Scheme, Prolog, C, and C++. The course provides a solid foundation in understanding the unique features, syntax, and paradigms of each language, enabling students to develop their problem-solving skills and adapt to new programming environments.

## Repository Contents

This repository contains the following types of programs:

- **Scheme Programs**: Functional programming examples written in Scheme.
- **Prolog Programs**: Logic programming examples and exercises written in Prolog.
- **C Programs**: Procedural programming examples and assignments written in C.
- **C++ Programs**: (Coming soon) Object-oriented programming examples and projects written in C++.

## Getting Started

To run the programs in this repository, you will need the appropriate compilers or interpreters for each programming language:

- For **Scheme**, install an interpreter such as [Racket](https://racket-lang.org/).
- For **Prolog**, install a compiler such as [SWI-Prolog](https://www.swi-prolog.org/).
- For **C** and **C++**, install a compiler such as [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/).

## Usage>

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the folder containing the program you wish to run.
3. Use the appropriate compiler or interpreter to run the program.
