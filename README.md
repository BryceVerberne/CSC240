# CSC 240 - Introduction to Different Programming Languages

Welcome to my CSC240 repository! This repository contains projects from my CSC 240 course: Introduction to Different Programming Languages, taken at Scottsdale Community College, taught by Professor Meacham.

## Course Description

CSC 240 is a course that covers the fundamentals of various programming languages, such as Scheme, Prolog, C, and C++. It provides a solid foundation in understanding the unique features, syntax, and paradigms of each language, enabling students to develop their problem-solving skills and adapt to new programming environments.

## Repository Contents

This repository contains the following types of programs:

- **Scheme Programs**: Functional programming examples written in Scheme.
- **Prolog Programs**: Logic programming examples and exercises written in Prolog.
- **C Programs**: Procedural programming examples and assignments written in C.
- **C++ Programs**: Object-oriented programming examples and projects written in C++.

## Getting Started

To run and modify the code in this repository, you will need the appropriate compilers or interpreters for each programming language:

- For **Scheme**, install an interpreter such as [Racket](https://racket-lang.org/).
- For **Prolog**, install a compiler such as [SWI-Prolog](https://www.swi-prolog.org/).
- For **C** and **C++**, install a compiler such as [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/).

## Disclaimer

These projects are provided for educational purposes only. While the code is free to share and use for non-commercial purposes, please do not use it to directly copy or plagiarize assignments for your coursework. Instead, use the material as a reference to help you understand the unique features, syntax, and paradigms of each langauge.
